## [Description](#table-of-contents)

This express.js application allows the user to enter notes and as they save, they appear in the sidebar on the left. Notes can be deleted by clicking the trash can delete button next to the corresponding note.

## [Installation](#table-of-contents)

Please download the files from the link below. You can copy these files to a directory in your local computer, or you can also clone it to directory. Open the file in VS Code. You want to make sure that Inqurier and Node are installed in your directory.

[Inquirer-Package](https://www.npmjs.com/package/inquirer)

## [Usage](#table-of-contents)

After installation is complete, run the following code: ‘node index’ in the terminal. Answer the prompts and after completion, you should see a console log showing your answers to your prompts, a message that says ‘File created!’, and you should see your file called ‘generated-README’. It’s generated in mark down syntax so you can copy and paste that code into your project!

I have also included a video with a demo of the project, and I also provided two screenshots. One image is if you have a project that uses a license, and the other image will demonstrate how the readme looks like if you have no license.
